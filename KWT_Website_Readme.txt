# King's Window Tint Website Copy Guidelines

## Purpose
This document is meant to serve as a reference for Codex (and any future collaborators) when working on King's Window Tint's website. It outlines the brand voice, storytelling approach, and content priorities so that all website copy feels consistent, authentic, and aligned with our goals.

---

## Brand Voice and Tone
- **First-Person, Genuine, Personal**  
  The website copy should read as if Skyler King (owner) is speaking directly to the visitor.  
  It should feel approachable, trustworthy, and rooted in personal experience.

- **Family Story and Legacy**  
  King’s is a two-generation, family-owned shop founded by Rex King and carried forward by Skyler.  
  This legacy should be woven into the storytelling throughout the site.

- **Core Values to Reflect**  
  - Care: every job gets the same precision and attention as if it were our own vehicle.  
  - Craftsmanship: clean edges, zero shortcuts, premium products.  
  - Trust: backed by lifetime warranty and personal guarantee.  
  - Expertise: 25+ years of consistent, proven work in the community.  

- **Tone Characteristics** (from Brand Essence Guideline):  
  - Passionate: show excitement about what tint/PPF can do.  
  - Expert: explain clearly, with confidence, without jargon.  
  - Approachable: professional but conversational, never stiff or corporate.  
  - Caring: demonstrate empathy and genuine concern for customers’ vehicles.

## Storytelling Approach
- Avoid generic claims like “the best tint in Columbus.”  
- Instead, acknowledge that every shop says they’re “the best,” and contrast it with what **our best** actually looks like (clean edges, premium film, warranty, no shortcuts).  
- Lean into the **family story**: carrying forward Rex King’s reputation and craftsmanship.  
- Position Skyler’s voice as the guide: someone who loves the craft, takes pride in details, and personally guarantees the work.  
- Customers should feel like they are talking to the owner, not reading faceless marketing copy.

## SEO Considerations
- Include keywords naturally in subheadings and body copy:

  - “Paint Protection Film Columbus, IN”  
  - “Ceramic Coating Columbus, IN”  
- Use family/legacy story and personal tone as differentiators (keeps it from sounding like keyword stuffing).  
- Meta title: “Window Tint & Paint Protection in Columbus IN | King’s”  
- Meta description: “Premium window tint, paint protection film, and ceramic coatings in Columbus, Indiana. Family-owned for 25+ years. Satisfaction guaranteed.”

## Final Reminder
Every page and section should pass this test:  
- Does it sound like Skyler personally speaking to the customer?  
- Does it highlight care, craftsmanship, and family legacy?  
- Does it avoid generic claims in favor of concrete proof?  
- Would Rex King be proud to see his reputation carried forward in these words?

If the answer is yes → it’s aligned with the King’s Window Tint brand.
